A short game made with vue only... Check it out at informationretrievalunit.github.io

How does it work?
It's made only with Vue.js, so it doesn't have any backend logic, thus it is being served on github pages as a static website without any problem. Graphics in the game are not made by me, but are just unicode emoji which you can use on your own machine too. Like in a text file, if you hold "alt", press "numpad3", release "alt", it should create a heart emoji â™¥

How may I use it?
You may visit the page and play it as many times as you want, without any cost. It's a simple game that I've made in a few days anyway. In case you couldn't figure yet, it's a match-3 kind of game. I'm not going to explain how to play it though :P

Please note that, this project is made as a demonstration of my skills.

Thank you for stopping by.
